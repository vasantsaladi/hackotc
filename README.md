To build a system that gathers information about countries and makes predictions on currency fluctuations based on that data using **MongoDB** for storing data and visualizing it on a web interface, you'll need to go through the following steps:

### 1. **Data Sources**:
   You need reliable financial data on currency movements and country-specific data (GDP, inflation rates, interest rates, etc.). You can pull data from:
   - **Alpha Vantage** (for real-time and historical currency data).
   - **World Bank APIs** (for country-specific economic indicators like GDP, inflation, etc.).
   - **IMF** and **OECD** (for additional macroeconomic data).
   - **News APIs** (for sentiment analysis, which can influence currency movements).

### 2. **Store Data in MongoDB**:
   - Set up a **MongoDB** database for storing all data collected from APIs.
   - Create collections for different data types (e.g., `currencies`, `economics`, `news`).
   - Example collections:
     ```json
     {
       "currency": "USD",
       "date": "2023-09-01",
       "rate": 1.23,
       "country": "USA"
     }
     ```
     ```json
     {
       "country": "USA",
       "gdp": 21000000,
       "inflation": 2.1,
       "interest_rate": 1.5,
       "date": "2023-09-01"
     }
     ```

### 3. **Preprocessing and Cleaning Data**:
   Clean and preprocess the data to ensure it's ready for analysis. You can use Python (with libraries like `pandas` or `numpy`) to handle this process:
   - Normalize currency data to account for time zones or missing data.
   - Normalize country-specific data.
   - Store data in MongoDB with timestamps and labels to allow easy querying.

### 4. **Develop a Machine Learning Model**:
   - Use historical currency data and country-specific data to train a machine learning model that predicts whether a currency will rise or fall.
   - Algorithms to consider:
     - **Time series forecasting**: ARIMA, LSTM, or Prophet models.
     -    We will be using LSTM
     - **Classification models**: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or XGBoost for predicting whether a currency will rise or fall based on country metrics.
   - You can use Python libraries like `scikit-learn`, `statsmodels`, `TensorFlow`, or `Prophet`.

### 5. **API Integration with MongoDB**:
   Build scripts to fetch and store data in MongoDB automatically:
   - Schedule data fetching using cron jobs or a task scheduler (such as **celery** with **Redis**).
   - Insert or update records in MongoDB as new data comes in.

### 6. **Visualizing Data on a Website**:
   - **Frontend**: Use **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** (or **React** for more dynamic web pages) to visualize data.
   - **Backend**: Use **Node.js** or **Flask/Django** to connect MongoDB and the frontend. Use `mongoose` or `pymongo` to fetch data from MongoDB and pass it to the frontend.
   - **Visualization Libraries**: Use libraries like:
     - **Chart.js** or **D3.js** for graphing currency trends.
     - **Plotly** for interactive charts and dashboards.
   - Example: Display historical exchange rate trends over time and allow users to select countries and view forecasts for the currency.

### 7. **Scoring & Prediction System**:
   Create a custom scoring or probability system based on model predictions:
   - Example: 
     ```json
     {
       "currency": "USD",
       "probability_of_rise": 0.75,
       "score": 85
     }
     ```
   - This score could be based on multiple factors:
     - Recent trends (e.g., positive news, favorable GDP reports).
     - Sentiment analysis from the news.
     - Machine learning modelâ€™s forecast based on time series analysis.

### 8. **Deploy the Web Application**:
   - Use cloud services like **Heroku**, **AWS**, or **Azure** to deploy your website.
   - MongoDB can be hosted on services like **MongoDB Atlas**.
   - Set up CI/CD pipelines for continuous deployment and testing.

### Stack Summary:
- **Frontend**: React or Vanilla JavaScript + Chart.js / D3.js for visualizing data.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express or Python (Flask/Django) for handling the API and fetching data from MongoDB.
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing and querying economic and financial data.
- **Data Sources**: APIs like Alpha Vantage, World Bank, IMF, news sentiment APIs.
- **ML Frameworks**: scikit-learn, TensorFlow, statsmodels (ARIMA/Prophet) for predictions.

### Next Steps:
Would you like help with setting up any specific part, like collecting data, building the machine learning model, or setting up the MongoDB integration?
